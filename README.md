Store Website

This repository, named public, is my first website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It represents my initial steps into web development and showcases my foundational skills in these technologies. The repository has a mix of HTML (48.6%), CSS (38.9%), and JavaScript (12.5%).

Limitations and Advantages


Ups:

Learning Experience: Creating this website was a tremendous learning experience. I gained a solid understanding of the basics of web development, including how to structure a webpage with HTML, style it with CSS, and add interactivity using JavaScript.

Hands-On Practice: This project allowed me to practice and apply what I learned from tutorials and courses. It was a hands-on way to solidify my understanding.

Portfolio Addition: This website serves as a portfolio piece that I can show to potential employers or clients, demonstrating my ability to create functional and aesthetically pleasing web pages.


Downs:

Initial Challenges: As this was my first project, I faced several challenges, such as debugging issues and understanding how different parts of the code interact.

Limited Features: The website has limited features and functionality compared to more advanced projects. It lacks the complexity and sophistication of more experienced developers' work.

Design Limitations: My design skills were still developing, so the website's design might not be as polished as I would like. There's room for improvement in terms of aesthetics and user experience.
